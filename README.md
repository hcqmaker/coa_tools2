## Description

COA Tools 2 is an add-on developed by [ndee89](https://github.com/ndee85) and modified/remade by [Aodaruma](https://github.com/Aodaruma/coa_tools2),hcqmaker which enables 2D rigging and animation within Blender.

[The original COA Tools by ndee89](https://github.com/ndee85/coa_tools) provided a rapid workflow for creating 2D cutout characters/animations in Blender. With COA Tools 2, the goal is to support Blender 3.4 and above, introduce automatic mesh generation, and establish a workflow with minimal features, allowing direct editing without going through proprietary modes.

The current Blender add-on release is tested with Blender 5.1.

Currently, the focus for development is on two aspects:

1. Photoshop sprite exporter
2. Blender add-on

The intention is to concentrate on these areas, specifically addressing the necessary improvements.

Since development is a time and resource-intensive process, it's not easy to being solely undertaken by me. However, if there are multiple developers willing to contribute and if the project necessitates scalability, I am considering inviting collaborators to join :)

## Development

The source code for active development is in the `develop` branch. `master` is reserved for stable releases. `coa_tools2` folder is a main body of the add-on. For efficient development, you can create a link to that folder in the Blender `addons` folder.

### Branch and Release Flow

- `develop`: integration branch for feature/fix work.
- `master`: stable branch for release-ready code.
- Pull requests to `master` must come from `develop` (or `hotfix-*` / `codex/hotfix-*`).
- Release tags on `master` use `vX.Y.Z` (example: `v2.1.3`) and create a draft release.
- Prerelease tags on `develop` use `vX.Y.Z-bN` (example: `v2.1.3-b1`) and create a draft prerelease.

``` bash
# Linux
LATEST_BLENDER_DIR=$(find "$HOME/.config/blender" -d 1 | grep -e "[0-9]\.[0-9]" | sort -rh | head -n 1)
ln -s "$PWD/coa_tools2" "$LATEST_BLENDER_DIR/scripts/addons/coa_tools2"
```

``` bash
# macOS
LATEST_BLENDER_DIR=$(find "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Blender" -d 1 | grep -e "[0-9]\.[0-9]" | sort -rh | head -n 1)
ln -s "$PWD/coa_tools2" "$LATEST_BLENDER_DIR/scripts/addons/coa_tools2"
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
$LatestBlenderDir = (Get-ChildItem "$env:APPDATA\Blender Foundation\Blender" -Directory | Where-Object { $_.Name -match "[0-9]\.[0-9]" } | Sort-Object -Descending | Select-Object -First 1).FullName
New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path "$LatestBlenderDir\scripts\addons\coa_tools2" -Value "$(Get-Location)\coa_tools2"
```

I'm using pipenv for dependency management. You can install the dependencies with `pipenv sync` if you have already installed pipenv.

Some extensions of vscode are recommended for development and written in `.vscode/extensions.json`. Feel free to use them.

### Documentation for development

The project includes several markdown documentation files in the `docs/` directory:

- **[docs/overview.md](https://github.com/Aodaruma/coa_tools2/blob/master/docs/overview.md)**: Provides a general introduction to developing COA Tools 2

- **[docs/specification.md](https://github.com/Aodaruma/coa_tools2/blob/master/docs/specification.md)**: Contains technical specifications and requirements for the Blender addon, including class structure, core features, and utility functions.

- **[docs/properties.md](https://github.com/Aodaruma/coa_tools2/blob/master/docs/properties.md)**: Comprehensive reference documentation for all COA Tools 2 properties in Blender addon, organized by category with detailed descriptions and type information.
